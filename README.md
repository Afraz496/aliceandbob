# Welcome to Alice and Bob's Repository!

Hi there! You probably stumbled across this amazing repo between Alice and Bob who are very excited to work on their first project together. Both of them decided that Alice will have ownership of the repo and keeps her work on the `main` branch. Bob wants to add files but does not want to limit Alice's work so he endeavours to create a new branch to do some of his prototyping work! For now Bob has chosen to label his branch `dev`. At the end of their project they are going to merge their work together and sell their awesome product!
